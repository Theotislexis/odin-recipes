        </p>
    <ul>
        <li><Chicken/li>
        <li>Yoghurt</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cream</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, mix your yogurt marinade together.</li>
        <li>Marinate chicken for 20 minutes, or overnight if time allows. (The longer it marinates, the more tender your chicken will be.)</li>
        <li>Sear chicken in a skillet or pan. Keep those charred bits on the pan to make your sauce. Browned bits = flavour. If you have too many burnt pieces stuck to the pan, you can discard some of them if you wish.</li>
        <li>Finally, make your curry sauce in the same skillet.</li>
