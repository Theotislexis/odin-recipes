I'll be building a simple recipe site
It won't be a large project but I'll make sure to begin putting the right approach to practice, and learn how the pros act. 
By the time I'm done, I'll prove that I'm capable of building a basic website with HTML, and that I understand the language enough to move on to deeper CSS studies.
